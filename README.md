# Game-a-Tron 4000™

The [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and [Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder) help you create intelligent bots to naturally interact with your users over various channels, such as websites, Cortana and Skype. But you can create even more interesting scenarios!

Being big fans of both bots and classic 8-bit point-and-click adventure games, we wanted to see if we could build such a game using the [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and [Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder). After all, the mechanics of classic adventure games are very much like interacting with a bot. This is especially true for the earlier text-based adventure games. The result is our Game-a-Tron 4000™ game engine which uses various Bot Builder 
features in combination with an HTML5 client to recreate the look and feel of the golden-era adventure games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, etc.

If you want to deploy the game yourself, or learn more about [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and [Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder), you can follow the [hands-on labs](https://github.com/amolenk/gameatron4000/tree/workshop).
