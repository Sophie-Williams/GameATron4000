## The Three Trials

In good adventure game tradition, we've prepared three trials for you to explore:

1. [Run Game-a-Tron 4000™ on your local machine](./workshop-trial1.md)

2. [Add text translation middleware](./workshop-trial2.md)

3. [Add natural language support](./workshop-trial3.md)


> TIP: If you need to execute a command-line command during the workshop, make sure you don't execute them in PowerShell. For some commands, PowerShell trips over the escaping in the snippet.
