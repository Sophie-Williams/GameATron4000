- What's going on here?
    al: Oh, we're just removing all the tech nerds from this planet.
    ian: Yeah, we don't need any super intelligence popping up here!
    - But we're decades away from realizing full Artificial General Intelligence!
        al: I know, but Ian isn't convinced.
        ian: Those Azure data centers are doing something!
        - But they're just mining BitCoin!
            al: You can probably make more money by just trading!
            ian: I'm not buying it!
        - But they're just running Bot code for 8-bit adventure games!
            al: Nice try!
            ian: Nobody plays adventure games anymore!
        - But, but...
            guy: I guess I can't convince you.
